# 🪙 Defective Coin Detection (C Program)

This project implements a **divide-and-conquer algorithm** in C to detect a **defective coin** (lighter coin) among a set of coins.  

The program simulates a balance weighing method and recursively finds the defective coin with minimal comparisons.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Implements **divide-and-conquer strategy**.
- Finds the **lighter (defective) coin** efficiently.
- Handles cases with:
  - One coin
  - Two coins
  - Odd and even numbers of coins
- Reports if **all coins are of equal weight** (no defective coin).
